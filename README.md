# Naval-Mine-Rock-Classifier
Developed a classifier to differentiate between naval mines and rocks present submerged in ocean using sonar signal inputs (frequency-modulated chirp). Data was analyzed for outliers and identification of missing values. Missing values were imputed usign suitable methods. Succesfully built the model using Logistic regression and Decision tree. Chance of improvement by using advanced classification models.
